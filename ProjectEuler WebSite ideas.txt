A little icon that would show which unsolved problems have a PDF... or is it only the first few ones?
If there are others, I'd work on solving those because it would be assured i would learn something from the PDF.  Rather than reading 4 pages of forums that only have solutions in various langages.

A rating system on the solved forums, so i could choose to sort by rating rather than just oldest first always.  Ideally i could sort by the language as well.  So then I could see only C-type languages if i wanted, and therefore easily compare what i have with those, and i would be able to submit mine if it is unique.


COMMENTS:
Problem 098:
I'd like to mention that in addition to not using a letter in a mapping more than once, you cannot use a digit mapping more than once.
For example:
2025:2025 as CARE:RACE does NOT work because R and C map to 2.
Seperate letters must map to seperate numbers, and neither can repeat in the mapping.
[This might go beyond this forum]
Anagrams which result in a number that is a sqare, but with a leading zero do not count either
